Hi everyone, I'm excited to announce my focus on transitioning into the tech industry as a UX researcher, data analyst, or data engineer. I'm passionate about understanding user needs and leveraging data to drive meaningful solutions.
I'm actively building my skillset to be a strong candidate for these roles. Here's what I'm working on:
Upskilling: I already have a UX research and design certificate, and I'm currently diving into SQL, Python, R, and Rust.
Exploring options: I'm open to opportunities in both UX research/design and data analysis/engineering, depending on the projects and teams that resonate with me.
Building community: I'm eager to connect with others in the industry and learn from your experiences. Follow me on LinkedIn ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/akiliaha-rankine/]) and my TikTok page (@uxunleashed) for updates and discussions!
Tips and tricks for career pivoting are also welcome! I'm eager to hear your advice and insights.
Thanks for supporting my journey!
